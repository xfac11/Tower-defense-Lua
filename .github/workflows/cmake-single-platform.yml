    # Specify the full SHA-1 hash of a Git commit (not a branch name, nor a tag!) that establishes which version of vcpkg needs to be used. When using vcpkg as a Git submodule, this input is *not* needed as implicitly specified by the submodule.

    # Specifies a semicolon separated list of regular expressions that are used to identify log file paths in the workflow output. A regular expression must have a single capturing group, that is a single pair of parenthesis such as 'See also (.+.log)'.
